 *
 *  @brief		Module for handling comm infrastructure for different devices with a single module.
 *
 *  			This module contains functions for sending and reading data over different communication interfaces.
 *  			By using this module when writing a protocol it does not matter if the communication interface is a
 *  			serial interface, can, ethernet or some other interface.
 *
 *				Many functions in this module work similar to functions in stdio.h, but do not need as many RAM/ROM.
 *				Also the stdio.h functions differ when using different compiler, so this module is a solution that works
 *				with all.
 *
 *	@version	2.09 (19.01.2022)
 * 				 - Modified to be used in esopekernel
 *	@version	2.08 (07.06.2018)
 *			     - Added module.h support
 *			     - Added docu in comm.c
 *			     - Shifted static variables to stack of comm_vprintf
 *			     - Renamed comm_t to comm_t and comm_interface_t to comm_interface_t
 *			     - Removed num_str from comm_t and put it into comm.c and externally in dbg.c
 *	@version	2.07 (24.05.2018)
 *				 - Added COMM_STRING_LENGTH_EXACT
 *				 - Added %#, %$ and %.
 *				 - Added %M, %m, %a, %A, %Q, %q and %B
 *	@version	2.06 (04.01.2015)
 *				 - Removed wait_for_data
 *				 - Uses convert/string.h functions internally. All internal functions were removed in the process.
 *				 - Added COMM_MAX_FORMAT_LENGTH to determine the internal buffer length for conversion data.
 *				 - Excluded dbg_ functions into dbg.c/dbg.h
 *				 - Added internal variables to the comm_t. Is needed if a printf is called in another printf or comm function.
 *	@version 	2.05 (16.02.2013)
 *				 - Translated the description to english
 *	@version 	2.04 (17.11.2012)
 *				 - dbg_vprintf added
 *  @version	2.03 (25.09.2011)
 *				 - include of mcu.h removed and included stdint.h and stdbool.h instead.
 *				 - dbg_printf added.
 *  @version	2.02 (22.09.2011)
 *				 - flush function added.
 *				 - vxprintf added.
 *  @version	2.01 (21.09.2011)
 *  			 - comm_interface_t structure added and functions from the comm_t included in the comm_interface_t.
 *  			 - functions edited for usage of the comm_interface_t
 *  @version	2.00 (19.09.2011)
 *  			 - Removed the old comm module and written everything from scratch.
