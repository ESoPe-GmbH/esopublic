 *
 *  @brief	Component is like a super class in object oriented programming.
 *  		Each component structure like a button or text structure MUST have a component_t as the first variable
 *  		inside its structure. This causes that the pointer to a button is also the pointer to its component_t.
 *  		Which makes it easy to use the component, when having only the button or text object. This is necessary for
 *  		screen and panel objects!
 *
 *	@version	1.01 (07.12.2018)
 *		- component_needs_cyclic_repaint added
 *  @version	1.00 (11.05.2014)
