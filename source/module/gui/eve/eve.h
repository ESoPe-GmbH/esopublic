 *
 *  @brief	The eve module is used for controlling the FTDI EVE graphic chip.
 *
 *  		The EVE chip offers 2 ways to draw something on the display.
 *  			1. Draw directly by writing commands into the display list of the eve chip.
 *  				1.1 eve_dl()_start is needed to start a new display list
 *  				1.2 eve_dl() can be used to add display list commands to the display list.
 *  					See EVE manual and eve_register.h for details. The defines in eve_register.h are named after
 *  					the manual, but every define has the prefix EVE_.
 *  				1.3 eve_dl_swap() is needed to end the display list and show the graphic on the screen.
 *  			2. Use the co-processor of the eve to store commands and then print it to the screen.
 *  			   See eve_copro.h for details. The process is like the display list process.
 *  				2.1 Check if eve_copro_is_ready() returns true -> Otherwise it might not work.
 *  				2.2 Use eve_copro_dlstart() to start a new display list via the co-processor.
 *  				2.3 (Optional) Use eve_copro_coldstart() to reactivate the standards of the co-processor.
 *  					For example if the color of buttons in the screen before were changed, this sets it back to default
 *  					color.
 *  				2.4 Now the co-processor commands can be called. See eve_copro.h for detailed description of the
 *  					following functions.
 *  					2.4.1 eve_copro_write_command() can add display list commands (same as eve_dl to co-processor).
 *  					2.4.2 eve_copro_set_color() to change the color of the following component.
 *  					2.4.3 eve_copro_set_foreground() to change the color of the following component.
 *  					2.4.4 eve_copro_set_background() to change the color of the following component.
 *  					2.4.5 eve_copro_set_gradientcolor() to change the color of the following component.
 *  					2.4.6 eve_copro_gradient() to draw a rectangle which was selected via scissor.
 *  					2.4.7 eve_copro_text() to add a text to the display.
 *  					2.4.8 eve_copro_button() to to add a button to the display.
 *  				2.5 End the co-processor display list via eve_copro_swap().
 *
 *			The gui module uses already the functionality mentioned above. So when using the gui, eve_copro.h might
 *			not be accessed manually. Initialization and handle of eve.h are needed nevertheless.
 *
 *	@version 	1.03 (13.11.2018)
 *		- Many undocumented changes
 *		- Solved bug with pwm cycle -> Displays stays dark after power on solved!
 *  @version	1.02 (18.09.2015)
 *  	- Interrupt register is now additionally checked every second in case an interrupt is missing
 *  	- Calibration for 5.7" changed
 *  @version	1.01 (06.01.2015)
 *  	- Touch Values for 5.7" added
 *  	- Added rotation parameter to eve_init
 *  	- Added rotated touch values for 4.3" and 5.7"
 *  @version	1.00 (07.05.2014)
 *  	- Intial release
 *
