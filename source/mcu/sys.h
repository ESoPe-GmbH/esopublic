 *
 *  @brief		Core function of the project, contains the main file. You need to implement the following functions externally:
 *  				void app_main_init(void);
 *  					-> Is called to initialize all application specific settings. The board_init is called auomatically in the main here.
 *  				void app_main_handle(void);
 *  					-> Is called periodically from the main while. Use this if main file should handle something.
 *
 *  			This module is used to have a global millisecond counter that can be used in all modules. By using this, time relevant modules do not use a timer for themselves.
 *				Be careful, because the counter is 32-bit and might overflow.
 *
 *				Be also careful that you have enough timer declared in mcu_config.h! You should set it to at least 2 because the mcu has also a timer for the active wait!
 *
 *	@version	1.05 (12.03.2021)
 *				 - Merge of ESP, ST and PC compatibility.
 *				 - Rename of the functions for the task and sleep mode to make the naming compatible with the naming convention.
 *				 - Added deprecated task defines for supporting old modules that do not use the new naming convention.
 *  @version    1.04 (03.07.2019)
 *               - system_add_task calls PT_INIT always, even if task was already added to start the task at the beginning!
 *               - Added SYSTEM_ENABLE_APP_MAIN_HANDLE to enable/disable app_main_handle
 *	@version	1.03 (24.05.2018)
 *				 - Now contains main with functions app_main_init and app_main_handle that needs to be implemented externally.
 *	@version	1.02 (13.09.2014)
 *				 - Task structure and functions (init, add, remove, handle) added.
 *	@version	1.01 (21.08.2013)
 *				 - Translated comments to english
 *				 - Changed unsigned long system_get_tick_count(void) to uint32_t system_get_tick_count(void).
 *				 - Renamed system_timter_millisec to system_timer_millisec.
 *  @version	1.00 (19.09.2011)
 *  			 - Initial release
 *
