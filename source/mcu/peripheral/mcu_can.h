 *
 *  @brief
 *  		Contains Definitions, Enumerations and Prototypes needed for the mcu_can functions, which can be used by
 *  		any MCU supporting this architecture.
 *
 *  @section	How-to-use
 *
 *	@subsection	mcu_htu_can_init CAN Bus
 *
 *	The can bus periphery is not offered in all controllers. To use it you need to initialize it first (like uarts).
 *	The initialization function needs the can number, tx and rx pin.
 *
 *	You need a can_handle for the can functions the example below shows.
@code
	mcu_can_t can_handle;
	...
	can_handle = mcu_can_init(1, P8_2, P8_3);	// CAN 1 with pin P8_2 and P8_3
@endcode
 *
 *	After the initialization you might want to receive data. This is a bit more complex then the uart receive.
 *	First you need to set the baudrate. Then you need to advice a receive buffer to the can module. These 2 steps are like the uart as shown
 *	in the example below.
@code
	uint8_t can_buffer[10*sizeof(can_frame_t)];	// Buffer fï¿½r 10 Pakete
	...
	mcu_can_set_baudrate(can_handle, 1000000);	// 1 MBit/s
	mcu_can_receive_enable(can_handle, MCU_INT_LVL_MED, can_buffer, 10); // 10 Pakete
@endcode
 *
 * 	To receive packages you need to tell the can module which packages you want to receive. For this you register receive messageboxes with
 * 	an address and an addressmask. The addressmask is used to listen for multiple addresses. If you set a bit in the addressmask to 1
 * 	the can module only receives packages where the corresponding bit in the received address is the same es the address you set in the
 * 	register function.
@code
	mcu_can_register_receive_messagebox(can_handle, 0x1FFFFFF0, 0x05, true);	// Extended IDs	(29-Bit) 0x00 - 0x0F
	mcu_can_register_receive_messagebox(can_handle, 0, 0, false);	// All Standard IDs (10-Bit)
@endcode
 *
 *	Now you can send and receive data. Below is an example that simply sends a received package back to the bus.
@code
	can_frame_t can_rx;
	...
	if(mcu_can_receive_package(can_handle, &can_rx))	// Returns true when a package was received.
		mcu_can_transmit_package(can_handle, can_rx);	// Sends a can package.
@endcode
